# IDD-Fa19-Lab2-Prelab


IDEA GENERATION: The point of this week's lab is to figure out a cool interaction that you can make possible with the timer capabilities of the micro controller. You could make a game where people have to try to press a button more times than their friend in a certain amount of time. You could make something that sings you to sleep, and gets quieter and quieter over 3 minutes. You could make something that you hit as you start to run down a hall, and then hit again, to see how fast you can run.

Please come up with 10 ideas of what you could do. They do not need to be potential market blockbusters. They do need to be things you feel like doing next week. You will also be asked to film one of your classmates trying out your idea, so pick things one of your classmates will be comfortable doing on film. Draw sketches with each of your ideas.
